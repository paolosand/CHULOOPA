## FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES (2026-2027)

### ICMC 2026 (International Computer Music Conference)
**Website:** https://www.computermusic.org/
**Estimated Dates:** September/October 2026
**Typical Deadline:** Spring 2026 (March-May)

#### Description
Long-established computer music conference, academically oriented, covers composition, performance, theory, and technology.

#### Fit for CHULOOPA
**Moderate fit.** ICMC is more academically rigorous and composition-focused than NIME. CHULOOPA's performance/interface angle would work but is less central to ICMC's traditional focus.

**Consider if:** NIME submission is rejected and you want a fallback in 2026.

---

### ISMIR 2026 (International Society for Music Information Retrieval)
**Website:** https://www.ismir.net/
**Estimated Dates:** November 2026
**Typical Deadline:** Spring 2026 (April-May)

#### Description
Focused on music information retrieval: recommendation systems, analysis, classification, generation, audio processing.

#### Fit for CHULOOPA
**Weak fit.** ISMIR is research-focused on algorithms and datasets. CHULOOPA's personalized KNN is not novel enough for ISMIR (they expect state-of-the-art ML). The interface/performance aspect doesn't align with ISMIR's scope.

**Verdict:** Not recommended unless you significantly expand the ML contribution.

---

### SMC 2026 (Sound and Music Computing)
**Website:** https://smcnetwork.org/
**Estimated Dates:** July 2026
**Typical Deadline:** Spring 2026 (February-April)

#### Description
European conference covering sound and music technology, bridging music, acoustics, and computing.

#### Fit for CHULOOPA
**Good fit.** SMC is similar to NIME but less performance-focused, more technical. Could be a good backup option.

**Verdict:** Reasonable backup if NIME doesn't work out.

---

### Web Audio Conference 2026
**Website:** https://webaudioconf.com/
**Estimated Dates:** 2026 (varies by year)
**Typical Deadline:** Spring 2026

#### Description
Focused on web audio technology, browser-based music apps, JavaScript audio processing. Industry-oriented (Mozilla, Google, Spotify attend).

#### Fit for CHULOOPA
**Poor fit currently.** CHULOOPA is ChucK-based, not web-based. Would need browser port.

**Verdict:** Not applicable unless system is ported to Web Audio API.

---

### NeurIPS Creative AI Workshop
**Website:** https://neurips.cc/ (workshop varies by year)
**Estimated Dates:** December 2026
**Typical Deadline:** Fall 2026

#### Description
Workshop at NeurIPS (premier ML conference) focusing on AI for creativity, generative models, artistic applications.

#### Fit for CHULOOPA
**Risky fit.** Gemini integration might be seen as "just API calls" rather than novel ML. KNN personalization is not state-of-the-art ML research.

**Verdict:** Only submit if CHULOOPA develops a novel ML contribution (e.g., new personalization algorithm, transfer learning approach).
